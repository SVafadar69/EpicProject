Our Group Project Repo, where we'll be pushing and pulling our updated code from. 

This is just a little reminder for what needs to be included at each stage of our project development. 

UPDATE: Project First Release
DUE: July 16th 

WHAT TO INCLUDE IN OUR FIRST RELEASE:

● Landing Page should include the Name of the Site and your Team’s Logo

● Landing Page should allow the user to post a listing for a used product

● Landing Page should allow the user to view publicly available and active used product listings

● The site should perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete/Disable) operations on the main type of site objects

WHAT IS NOT REQUIRED:
